Written in .NET8;  VS Community Edition 2022
Stealth Bridget SDK uses Python.Net to interact with py_stealth folder.

You need Python 3.11.8 in order to make this work properly as we are using pythonnet 3.0.1 which is grabbed using NuGet Package Manager


you must edit bridgeconfig.json to properly run the SDK.
